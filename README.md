___S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Anomaly 1.5.1___

3DVision fix for S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Anomaly 1.5.1

This game is a free standalone mod based on S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat and can be downloaded from here: https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly



___Fixed

• Haloing issues (based on DJ-RK's Call of Pripyat fix)
• Shadows, lighting and decals (based on DJ-RK's Call of Pripyat fix)
• Screenspace and volumetric sunrays
• Specular reflections
• Water reflections
• Parallax bump mapping
• Dynamic crosshair
• Low convergence preset for the 3D PDA



___Installation

Copy the contents of the Fix folder to "Stalker Anomaly\bin".

In the Anomaly Launcher select the DirectX 11 Renderer and enable "Support for AVX CPU".

Run the game and set the following in Settings -> Visual -> Advanced:

• Detail bump: Enabled
• Steep parallax: Enabled
• SSAO mode: Anything except SSDO

Pretty much everything else should work but I recommend turning down the Grass and Rendering Distance options as these have a lot of performance impact. Note that changing some of the graphics settings requires a restart, even if the game doesn't say so.

Also note that some alt tabbing is necessary to launch the game in Fullscreen mode, and the global driver hack needs to be enabled in 3DFM if you get a black screen.



___Hotkeys

Backspace: Cycle convergence values

Right Mouse Button: Low convergence preset for aiming down sights



___Other notes

• Some textures may look funky due to the stereoized parallax bump mapping. Small price to pay for making them realistic.

• Decals and shadows float a bit on certain surfaces. This is normal and it's just how they are rendered natively in 2D.

• There are countless addons for this game so if you find anything cool that works with this fix make sure to leave a comment.
